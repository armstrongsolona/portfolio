  I built one of the first websites for LaSenza, the lingerie company, complete with a Flash 
  introduction when it was cutting edge. I've evolved with the industry and now I specialize 
  in front end development.`,
  `If I had to choose only one word to describe myself, it would be resourceful. I often
  find creative ways to solve problems. I also have a wide array of skills and interests,
  like teaching and writing, that have all contributed to my value as a developer.`,
  `I'm meticulous about details and appreciate high quality, both on screen and in code.
  Having an impact motivates me, so I always give 100%.`,
  `Colleagues often tell me how much they enjoy working with me. I'm friendly and like to
  be helpful. I also make shameless puns and laugh at my own jokes.`
